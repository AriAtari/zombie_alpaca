# Zombie Alpacalypse

## The story so far.
One day everyone lived in peace and harmony thanks to the abunace of precious alpacas to pet. The alpacas helped people destress and have an uplift in mood. But one day a toxic waste spill from the nuclear energy corporation "nuke'em" fell into the river that the adorable alpacas drink from. This caused the alpacas to become neon green but they were still pasifists, however, they now have an abilty to make people into zombies through touch. Humans knew this but they are just so cute people couldnt stop petting them and turning into zombies.Its an ALPACALYPSE!!!

## Introduction
In this project, we simulate the fallout of a zombie alpacalypse in which we see a horde of zombie alpacas attacking a crowd of unsuspecting humans. Based heavily on the standard_model.py code from HMK 2, we start by simulating crowd of randomly moving humans and zombies that wander around an area of a set size. If the human and zombie end up wandering onto the same space as one another, the human is bitten by the zombie and becomes a zombie themselves.

After creating this basic simulation, we then went on to add a number of different behaviors exhibited by both the humans and zombies to increase the complexity of our model. Some of these behaviors include: Giving the zombie alpacas the ability to 'smell' humans that are within a certain distance of them, the ability for humans to fight back against the zombies and grow stronger from each zombie they succesfuly kill, and the ability for humans to pick up weapons to further increase their likely hood of sucessfully killing a zombie.
